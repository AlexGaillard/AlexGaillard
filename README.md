### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a former adman turned software engineer who loves to tinker across the stack. The majority of my experience is working on the front end, especially with React, Redux and responsive CSS/SASS. However I also have some experience across the stack with database and api design and some of the more daunting technologies like Docker.

On the front end I am currently focusing on learning Typescript and constantly find myself in awe of how easily it points out your own stupid mistakes to you.

On the backend side I have also been putting a lot of time of Cloud hosting and have set up a number of web servers on both Linode and AWS which I now use to run and test side projects while learning the ins and outs of cloud architecture and performance and security management.
